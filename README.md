#Code and repositories adapted from:

https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix - code found in the 'gan' subfolder
and
https://github.com/ErwannMillon/Color-diffusion - code found in the 'diffusionmodel' subfolder

The dataset can be downloaded here: https://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html

The Licenses included in the subfolders apply. 
Checkpoints can be provided upon request, but it is not guaranteed that they will work. 
A CUDA capable machine is needed, as i had to modify some scripts to be able to train on a GPU.
For training and inference with my parameters, adapt the PowerShell Scripts or manually execute the 3-4 lines contained in each script.
